# oc_loadtester 0.8.1

## Description
The oc_loadtester allow to perform custom Gatling simulations to generate some load on a single or multiple ownCloud servers. 
The oc_loadtester was tested for Ubuntu 14.04,  Gatling 2.1.6, ownCloud 7.0.4, ownCloud 8.0.3, PostgreSQL 9.3.6 and Java 7.

The simulation was written in Scala (localized in: ./gatling) and can be used in custom scenarios (some examples in: ./gatling/examples)

The script for multiple ownCloud simulation (localized in ./scripts) modifies the original [script](https://github.com/gatling/gatling/blob/416fb4364d25085bb207121d8b87e05836e8abb3/src/sphinx/cookbook/code/GatlingScalingOut.sh)
